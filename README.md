# Space Colony
This is a hackathon project made in Unity. It's a simple space colony
game where the player begins on Earth and can colonize the inner planets
of the solar system.

Colonies have several buildings controlling different
resources, like food or energy. The challenge is balancing resource
production to sustain a population while the colony becomes sustainable.

## Mechanics
Each building takes minerals to build and requires energy and 1 population
to operate. Each population consumes 1 food and 1 consumer good, if there
are not enough then the population shrinks. Food production depends on a
planets habitability, which can be modified with a terraformer building.

A planets max population depends on its habitability and how many houses
have been built. Population grows if there is an excess of food and
consumer goods.
